# Smart-Traffic-Management-System
** 1. Overview**

An AI-driven traffic management system designed to optimize signal control dynamically using real-time video analytics and distributed coordination across multiple intersections.

The system leverages computer vision models for traffic density estimation, emergency vehicle detection, and accident identification. It integrates a centralized coordination server to enable intelligent decision-making and inter-intersection communication, forming a scalable foundation for smart city traffic systems.

**2. Objectives**

-> Reduce traffic congestion through adaptive signal timing
-> Enable priority routing for emergency vehicles
-> Detect and report accidents in real-time
-> Coordinate nearby intersections for optimized traffic flow

**3. Key Features**

3.1 Adaptive Traffic Signal Control
-> Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv8
-> Dynamic green time allocation based on traffic density (PCU model)
-> Multi-lane, multi-phase signal management

3.2 Emergency Vehicle Prioritization
-> Ambulance detection using a fine-tuned model
-> Immediate prioritization of detected lane within the intersection
-> Emergency signal propagation to nearby intersections (≤ 1 km radius)

3.3 Accident Detection & Alerting
-> Custom-trained model for accident detection
-> Automatic alert dispatch to central authority
-> Real-time notification via server

 3.4 Distributed Coordination System
-> Central server built using FastAPI
-> Intersections communicate via REST APIs
->Emergency mode broadcast to nearby intersections

3.5 Monitoring Dashboard
-> WebSocket-based real-time updates
-> Displays emergency states and alerts
-> Prototype implementation (requires further stabilization)

**4. System Workflow**

4.1. Video Acquisition

-> Each lane is processed via a dedicated thread
-> Frames are continuously extracted from video streams

4.2. Detection Pipeline

-> Vehicle detection → Traffic density estimation
-> Ambulance detection → Emergency trigger
-> Accident detection → Alert generation

4.3. Local Decision Engine

-> Computes optimal signal timing using PCU
-> Dynamically updates phase durations

4.4. Central Communication

-> Sends events (ACCIDENT / AMB_START / AMB_STOP) to server
-> Receives emergency mode instructions

4.5. Distributed Response

-> Nearby intersections enter emergency mode
-> Source intersection prioritizes emergency lane

**5. Core Components**

5.1 Phase Management
-> Maintains signal state (RED, YELLOW, GREEN)
-> Implements locking mechanism for stable transitions
-> Stores latest frame for processing

5.2 Phase Scheduler
-> Controls signal transitions
-> Handles Normal and Emergency modes
-> Ensures continuous and adaptive operation

5.3 Detection Modules
-> YOLOv8 (base model) → Vehicle detection
-> Custom-trained model → Accident detection
-> Custom-trained model → Ambulance detection

5.4 Central Server
-> Event processing and routing
-> Geospatial filtering using Haversine formula
-> Emergency propagation to nearby intersections
-> WebSocket-based real-time communication
